## Summary of `findNewScoreReports()`

The `findNewScoreReports()` function identifies SAT admin spreadsheets within a parent folder that have been updated within a specified time limit (default: 5 days). It processes these files to check for new completed tests and generates score reports for them. If no `students` parameter is provided, it retrieves student data from the "Clients" sheet in the `clientDataSs` spreadsheet.

## Usage

### 1. Copy the functions listed from the two files below, and paste them into a [new Apps Script project](https://script.google.com/home/projects/create)

#### `scoreReports.gs`

- **`findNewScoreReports()`**: Main function to identify updated SAT admin spreadsheets.
- **`findNewCompletedTests(fileList)`**: Processes the list of updated files to check for new completed tests.
- **`createSatScoreReports(spreadsheetId, scores)`**: Generates SAT score reports for completed tests.
- **`sendPdfScoreReport(spreadsheetId, studentName, scoresUpToCurrent)`**: Sends the PDF score report via email.
- **`savePdfSheet(spreadsheetId, sheetId, studentName)`**: Exports a specific sheet as a PDF.
- **`mergePDFs(fileIds, destinationFolderId, name)`**: Merges multiple PDF files into one.
- **`getStudentsSpreadsheetData(studentName)`**: Retrieves student data from the "Summary" sheet.

#### `helpers.gs`

- **`getLastFilledRow(sheet, col)`**: Finds the last filled row in a column.
- **`getTestCodes()`**: Retrieves unique test codes from the "Practice test data" sheet.
- **`getOPTPermissionsList(id)`**: Retrieves a list of editors for a file.


### 2. Set Up the Script Properties

Ensure the `clientDataSsId` property is set in the script properties. This should point to the ID of the spreadsheet containing the "Clients" sheet.

- Go to **Project Settings** (the gear icon in the left sidebar).
- Scroll to the bottom and click **Add script property**.
- Name the property `clientDataSsId` and add the ID of your client data spreadsheet (the part of the Sheets URL between `/d/` and the trailing slash).
- You can make a copy of this spreadsheet:

### 3. Remove or update code as needed

- `getOPTPermissionsList()` is designed to send a group email to any @openpathtutoring.com email addresses that has access to a student's admin spreadsheet. This is useful if more than one person in the organization should receive the score report. The tutor or admin can then forward the email to a parent and/or student. You can either switch the domain name within getOPTPermissionsList to your own domain name or replace `const email = getOPTPermissionsList()` in `sendPdfScoreReport()` with `const email = 'youremail@yourdomain.com`.
- Remove `const studentData = getStudentsSpreadsheetData()` in `sendPdfScoreReport()` and simplify the `const message` to exclude `studentData` references (including the `if(studentData.hours)` conditional statement.)
- Adjust the time limit in `findNewScoreReports()` if needed:
  ```javascript
  const msInTimeLimit = 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 5 days
  ```

### 4. Create Daily Triggers for `updateOPTStudentFolderData` and `findNewScoreReports`

- In the left sidebar of the Apps Script editor, click **Triggers** (the stopwatch icon).
- Click **Add trigger** in the bottom right corner.
- Select `updateOPTStudentFolderData` from the function list.
- Select **Time-driven** from event source.
- Leave the deployment set as **Head**.
- Choose **Daily timer** and the hour during which youâ€™d like the function to run.
- Repeat the process for `findNewScoreReports`.

**Recommendation:**
Run `updateOPTStudentFolderData` before `findNewScoreReports` each day, since the latter searches for new tests from the folder data that is saved to the `clientDataSs` by the update function.

---

### 5. Test the Function

Run `updateOPTStudentFolderData()` and `findNewScoreReports()` manually to ensure they work as expected before relying on the triggers. When `updateOPTStudentFolderData()` completes, you should see values entered into the "Clients" sheet. `findNewScoreReports()` should run from the Apps Script editor without errors.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Daily Trigger Execution**: The trigger runs `updateOPTStudentFolderData()` and `findNewScoreReports()` every day at the specified time.
2. **File Identification**: `findNewScoreReports()` identifies updated SAT admin spreadsheets.
3. **Test Processing**: `findNewCompletedTests()` checks for new completed tests in the identified files.
4. **Score Report Generation**: `createSatScoreReports()` generates score reports for completed tests.
5. **PDF Export and Email**: `sendPdfScoreReport()` exports the score report as a PDF and emails it to the relevant recipients.
